# fe2lua
A transpiler that turns rxi's [fe](https://github.com/rxi/fe) to Lua, also written in Lua.

Made this project for fun, saving it here since I don't wanna lose it in case something bad happens.

Some things here don't actually work, like macros or the quote shorthand (I might change that though)
